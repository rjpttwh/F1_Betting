# F1_Betting is a project written by me. I noticed that skybets has multiple "request a bet" catergories. In these are bets, much like accumulators, that require multiple coditions be met, but they come with competitive odds, such as 11/1, 33/1, and 50/1. This piece of code scrapes bets from the skybets website (for the most upcomming Grand Prix) and then filters through the bets using a driver's average placement +/-2 to calcualte if the bet is appropriate for investing in. 

# Worth noting also that the code errors a lot, this is due to data_sorting function starting on line 98. This error happens becasue the language used on skybets is inconsistent and as such the replacemnts dictionary is occasionally out of date. At the time of writing I plan to create a config file so that no editing of F1BettingMain.py is needed
